# WSQ08_YoSoy196
What to Do Your job is to create a program that asks the user for two pieces of data:  The lower bound of the sequence The upper bound of the sequence Then you check the values from the lower bound (inclusive) to the upper bound (inclusive) and make a report of them. During the analysis of each number, if a Lychrel number is found it should be reported immediately with something like “Found a Lychrel number: 196” Details The report must show: The range of numbers analysed (lower to upper bound) The number of natural palindromes (no addition to inverse needed) The number of non-Lycherels encountered (become palindromes) The number of Lycherel number candidates (that did not converge to palindrome) Since you will not be able to prove that a number is Lycherel (since you cannot computer forever to check), our definition for a Lycherel candidate will be if a number does not converge after 30 iterations of applying the addition to the inverse.
